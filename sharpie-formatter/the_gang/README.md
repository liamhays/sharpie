These are various versions of a screenshot from an early episode of
[Kill la Kill](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill), cropped
to 4:3, rescaled, and dithered. I
made these by hand with various odd tools (mostly
[dither](https://gitlab.com/efronlicht/dither)) before `sharpie-formatter`
could do all the image processing by itself, and they're here
for archival purposes.

Note in particular the dithering variants under `processed/`. I settled
on Floyd-Steinberg for `sharpie-formatter` specifically because of how
it preserved the detail in this frame.
