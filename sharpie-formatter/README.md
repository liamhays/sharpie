This is a little Rust program to convert images (whatever the Rust
`image` library supports) into formatted data to be put on the
Sharpie display. `sharpie-formatter` doesn't actively stream data, it
just converts between file formats and applies transformations to images.
See the output of `--help` for details on available operations.
